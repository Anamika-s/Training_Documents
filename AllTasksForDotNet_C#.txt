Day 1:
Task 1: .NET Framework Overview Report
Write a one-page report detailing the evolution of the .NET Framework to .NET 5, emphasizing the key differences and improvements made over time. Include a section on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), explaining its functionality and impact on .NET applications.

Task 2: Class Library Research and Code Example
Research the .NET Class Library and compile a list of five commonly used classes along with their namespaces. For one of these classes, write a short C# code snippet that demonstrates a common use case, including inline comments to explain the code.

Task 3: Visual Studio Project Setup Diary
Install Visual Studio and create a new project using a template relevant to your learning goals. Document each step with screenshots in a ""setup diary"". If you encounter any setup issues, note down the problem and how you resolved it.

Task 4: C# Programming and Debugging Practice
Write a C# program that prints ""Hello, World!"" to the console, then modify it to prompt the user for their name and greet them personally. Debug a provided C# code snippet that contains several deliberate errors. Document each error found, the debugging process, and the final corrected code.

Day 2:
Task 1: Mastering Type Conversion
Create a C# console application that prompts the user for an integer and a double, then demonstrates both implicit and explicit conversion. Display the results of conversion and any loss of data if it occurs.

Task 2: Variable Scope and Lifetime Illustration
Design a C# program with a method that attempts to access a local variable outside its scope, a constant, and a static variable. Document the results in comments within the code explaining why each access either succeeds or fails.

Task 3: Implementing Control Structures
Write a C# application that uses nested if-else statements to classify a number as positive, negative, or zero, and then iterates from that number to zero using a for loop, printing each number to the console.

Task 4: Numerical Algorithms Implementation
1. Code the Euclidean algorithm in C# to find the GCD of two user-input numbers and display the result.
2. Implement an exponentiation function to calculate and print the result of a user-input base and exponent.
3. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number, where n is provided by the user, using matrix exponentiation.

Day 3:
Task 1: Array Manipulation Functions
a) Create a function named InitializeArray that initializes an array with a given size and fills it with random integers.
b) Develop functions named InsertElement, DeleteElement, UpdateElement, and ReverseArray that perform the corresponding operations on an array. Provide a brief comment on each function describing its behavior."

Task 2: Array Sorting and Searching
a) Implement a function called BruteForceSort that sorts an array using the brute force approach. Use this function to sort an array created with InitializeArray.
 b) Write a function named PerformLinearSearch that searches for a specific element in an array and returns the index of the element if found or -1 if not found.

Task 3: Two-Sum Problem
a) Given an array of integers, write a program that finds if there are two numbers that add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Optimize the solution for time complexity.

Task 4: Understanding Functions through Arrays
a) Write a recursive function named SumArray that calculates and returns the sum of elements in an array, demonstarte with example.

Task 5: Advanced Array Operations
a)  Implement a C# method SliceArray that takes an array, a starting index, and an end index, then returns a new array containing the elements from the start to the end index.
b) Create a recursive function in C# to find the nth element of a Fibonacci sequence and store the first n elements in an array.

Day 4:
Task 1: Inheritance and Method Overriding
1) Design a base class Employee with properties for name, title, and base salary. Create a derived class Manager that inherits from Employee and includes a method to calculate a bonus based on performance. Override the method to display employee details to include bonus information for managers.

Task 2: Polymorphism with Interfaces
1) Define an interface IDrivable with methods for Start, Stop, and Drive. Implement this interface in two classes, Car and Bicycle. Demonstrate polymorphism by writing a method that takes an IDrivable object and invokes each method.

Task 3: Encapsulation with Complex Property Logic
1) Develop a class Account where the balance cannot be directly set from outside the class. Provide a deposit method and a withdraw method, which include validation checks and throw exceptions for invalid operations like withdrawing more than the balance.

Day 5:
Task 1: Implementing a Linked List
1) Write a C# class CustomLinkedList that implements a singly linked list with methods for InsertAtBeginning, InsertAtEnd, InsertAtPosition, DeleteNode, UpdateNode, and DisplayAllNodes. Test the class by performing a series of insertions, updates, and deletions.

Task 2: Stack and Queue Operations
1) Create a CustomStack class in C# with operations Push, Pop, Peek, and IsEmpty. Demonstrate its LIFO behavior by pushing integers onto the stack, then popping and displaying them until the stack is empty.
2) Develop a CustomQueue class with methods for Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, and IsEmpty. Show how your queue can handle different data types by enqueuing strings and integers, then dequeuing and displaying them to confirm FIFO order.

Task 3: Priority Queue Scenario
a) Implement a priority queue in C# to manage emergency room admissions in a hospital. Patients with higher urgency should be served before those with lower urgency.

Day 6: 
Task 1: Real-time Data Stream Sorting
A stock trading application requires real-time sorting of trade transactions by price. Implement a heap sort algorithm that can efficiently handle continuous incoming data, adding and sorting new trades as they come.

Task 2: Linked List Middle Element Search
You are given a singly linked list. Write a function to find the middle element without using any extra space and only one traversal through the linked list.

Task 3: Queue Sorting with Limited Space
You have a queue of integers that you need to sort. You can only use additional space equivalent to one stack. Describe the steps you would take to sort the elements in the queue.

Task 4: Stack Sorting In-Place
You must write a function to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure such as an array. The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.

Task 5: Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List
A sorted linked list has been constructed with repeated elements. Describe an algorithm to remove all duplicates from the linked list efficiently.

Task 6: Searching for a Sequence in a Stack
Given a stack and a smaller array representing a sequence, write a function that determines if the sequence is present in the stack. Consider the sequence present if, upon popping the elements, all elements of the array appear consecutively in the stack.

Task 7: Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists
You are provided with the heads of two sorted linked lists. The lists are sorted in ascending order. Create a merged linked list in ascending order from the two input lists without using any extra space (i.e., do not create any new nodes).

Task 8: Circular Queue Binary Search
Consider a circular queue (implemented using a fixed-size array) where the elements are sorted but have been rotated at an unknown index. Describe an approach to perform a binary search for a given element within this circular queue.
